MDEForge Doubts

1. Why workspace entity contains a list of artifacts?.
2. Why we aren't respect the relationship presented on the class diagram?.

Share project to users

suppose you share a project to a list of users
what happens if a user has already that project id?
be careful with the compensate operation in a saga with that shared project because the problem is when an update saga is executed and was wrong for any reasons, 
so compensate share project to user is activated and it can delete a relation project - user.
